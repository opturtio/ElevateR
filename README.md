# ElevateR
#### “Elevation Map for Public Transport Travel Time”
This project is for the Introduction to Data Science course, which is part of the Master's in Computer Science program. The project was implemented in collaboration between three students [opturtio](https://github.com/opturtio), [kokorohoriuchi](https://github.com/kokorohoriuchi), and [ireshh](https://github.com/ireshh).

## Overview

**ElevateR** is a web application that visualizes public transportation stations in Helsinki and provides users with the ability to interact with a map, select a station, and "elevate" it to display travel times from the selected station to nearby stations using a heatmap. It integrates with the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) API to fetch data related to stations and itineraries.

The application has both a backend, written in Python using Flask, and a frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Leaflet for map rendering and data visualization.
